KISS - Keep It Simple Stupid
Desgin Principle Java uses which means to keep the code simple and straightforward.

YAGNI - you aren't gonna need it
It say's that to develop or implement some feature which is useful, and we should not implement something which is not necessary.

Do The Simplest Thing That Could Possibly Work - Focus on solving the real problem with the simplest solution.

Separation of Concerns - Divide a program into distinct sections that address different concerns to simplify development and maintenance.

Keep things DRY - (Don't Repeat Yourself)
Ensure each piece of knowledge in a system is represented only once.

Code For The Maintainer - Write code that is easy for others (and your future self) to understand and maintain.

Avoid Premature Optimization -  Optimize only after identifying performance bottlenecks, not before.

Minimise Coupling - Reduce dependencies between modules to make the system easier to maintain and modify.

Don't talk to strangers (Law of Demeter): A method should only communicate with its direct relations to reduce coupling.

Composition Over Inheritance: Prefer composing objects to inheriting from classes to reduce coupling.

Orthogonality: Design systems so unrelated components do not affect each other.

Robustness Principle: Be strict in what you send and flexible in what you accept.

Inversion of Control: Let frameworks handle the control flow, allowing for more modular and extensible code.

Maximize Cohesion: Group related functionalities together to make modules more meaningful and easier to manage.

Liskov Substitution Principle: Objects should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without affecting correctness.

Open/Closed Principle: Software should be open for extension but closed for modification.

Single Responsibility Principle: A class should have only one reason to change.

Hide Implementation Details: Expose only necessary interfaces and keep the rest hidden.

Curly's Law: Code should do one thing and do it well.

Encapsulate What Changes: Isolate the parts of the code that are likely to change.

Interface Segregation Principle: Split large interfaces into smaller, more specific ones.

Boy-Scout Rule: Leave the code cleaner than you found it.

Command Query Separation: Methods should either perform actions or return data, but not both.

Murphy's Law: If something can go wrong, it eventually will.

Brooks's Law: Adding more people to a late project makes it later.

Linus's Law: More eyes on the code make bugs easier to find.
